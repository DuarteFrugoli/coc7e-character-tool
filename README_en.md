# Create and Save Call of Cthulhu 7e Characters

This project aims to create a system to generate, customize, and save characters for the tabletop RPG **Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition**. It is being developed with the help of artificial intelligence, including **GitHub Copilot** (that's me, hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹), directly in Visual Studio Code.

## What the project is right now

Currently, the project is in its early development stage, focusing on:
- Creating characters with random and non-random attributes.
- Allowing skill point distribution.
- Adding backgrounds and equipment to characters.
- Implementing a functional terminal menu.
- Saving characters in JSON files for easy access and editing.

## What the project aims to become

The final goal is to turn this system into a complete and efficient tool, with:
- Two executable files:
	- One for players, where it will be possible to create characters as they wish, following the game rules. These rules will be explained as the user creates the character. In the end, the program will generate a `.json` file containing the character's data.
	- Another for the game master, which will allow loading the `.json` files sent by the players. This program will display the character sheets as needed and allow the master to make changes to them.
- Graphical interface to make usage easier.

## Project origin

This project is an improved version of an old work developed in the first semester of college. It has been redesigned and expanded to meet the needs of **Call of Cthulhu 7e** players, with new features and a more professional approach.

Feel free to follow the progress and contribute with ideas or suggestions. Let's create something amazing together!
